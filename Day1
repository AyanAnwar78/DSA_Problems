1. Remove All Occurrences of a Substring
link: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-occurrences-of-a-substring/description/

CODE:
class Solution {
public:
    string removeOccurrences(string s, string part) {
        while(s.length()>0 && s.find(part)<s.length()){
            s.erase(s.find(part), part.length());
        }
        return s;
    }
};

find(part) returns the starting position of the first occurrence of part in s.
As long as that position is valid (i.e., less than s.length()), we call erase() to remove part from s.
This repeats until no more occurrences of part are found.
